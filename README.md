# Odin Project #23: Mini Message Board

The goal of this Odin Project assignment was to create a simple message board using Express and EJS. The user can browse existing messages and add new ones. The app doesn't use a real database yet, it uses a JS array instead.

I started and finished this project in August 2024.
